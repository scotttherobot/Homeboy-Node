### Homeboy!

This is the configuration management server for Homeboy, and Android app
for Android phones indented to repurpose phones as home automation
remote controls.

The configuration file, `remote_config.json`, is where you make your 
configuration changes. Define your commands as HTTP requests, and then
define configurations for remotes that reference those commands.

To install the remote app on your Android phone, see the
[Homeboy-Android](https://github.com/scotttherobot/Homeboy-Android) repo
to get that taken care of.
